# rnn-from-scratch

Implementation of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from scratch (char-rnn). 

All the RNN code is in `rnn.py`.

`test.py` is used for defining an instance of the RNN and training it.

`generate.py` is for generating characters.

`uwv.pkl` contains weights for the trained model.  If you run `test.py`, the model will load the weights from this file and continue training from there.
